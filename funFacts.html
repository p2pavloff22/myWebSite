/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Create two arrays: group and facts.
2. Use a for loop to increment the idirator by one (linear search). 
3. Use document.getElementById to correlate the element value of group to the same element value of facts.
4. Use a linear search to find the value of group
5. Use a button to display the correct fun fact that correlates with the value found from group in the linear search.
6. The getIndex function will allow us to do the previous step.
7. Use a return answer to display the fun fact about the artist.
8. (I could use a little more help with what to write for algorithms)
