/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Create two arrays: questions and answers
2. Use docucment.getElementById to display the question when a button is pressed
3. Allow the user to answer the question in another textbox with a different document.getElementById
4. Use a parameter to check whether their answer was correct
5. Make an if statement that checks their answer to the actual answer
6. Use an if statement that adds a point if they were correct
7. Create a button that then cycles to the next question
8. Repeat the process
